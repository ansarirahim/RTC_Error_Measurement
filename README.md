# RTC_Error_Measurement
This project will measure RTC Pulse width and compare it with OCXO 10MHz so that we can get the error in parts per million.

RTC_START_512==> command will do for the RTC having 512 Hz freq
RTC_START_32 ==> command will do for the RTC having 32 Hz freq
RTC_START_32768 ==> command will do for the RTC having 32768 freq
RTC_COUNTS? ==> command will do the task to get number of counts of OCXO during these pulses..eg:512 pulses.
